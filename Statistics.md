# Statistics Resources 

## General Statistics
- [Think Stats](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) - _Think Stats_ is an introduction to Probability and Statistics for Python programmers.
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)  - This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. 
It's also provides code in R (which is not relevant for our class), but it's really great from the theoretical perspective. Website contains a free PDF.  
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) - This book is a more advanced book, but also a great resource. You can download a PDF version for free. 
- [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) - Bayesian statistics is beyond the scope of this class, but if you're interested, this is a great book. Free PDF can be downloaded as well.

## Statistical Inference
- [STAT 415 Intro Mathematical Statistics (Penn State)](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/213) - great resource for more details on statistical inference. Its preceding course, [STAT 414 Intro Probability Theory](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/287/) is also worth checking.

- [StackOverflow Link to Confidence Interval in SciPy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28242593/correct-way-to-obtain-confidence-interval-with-scipy).
- [Computer-age Statistical Inference](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) - A 2016 book that covers various topics in statistical inference that are relevant in this data-science era, with scalable techniques applicable to large datasets. A free PDF can be [downloaded from here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi_corrected_11102017.pdf).
